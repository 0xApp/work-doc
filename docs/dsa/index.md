# Algorithms

An algotithm is a finite set of steps or instruction to solve a given problem.

## Properties of an algorithm.

 - It takes zero or more inputs.
 - It should produce one or more output.
 - It should be deterministic.
 - It should terminate in finite time.

## Asymptotic analysis or Asymptotic Notations

Asymptotic notation is used to denote the efficieny of algorithms independent of any dataset. We are generally interested in order of growth of an algorithm, and not interested in exact time required for algorithm.

The complexity of an algorithm is the amount of time or space required by the algorithm to process the input and produce the output.

There are two types of complexity:

 - **Time Complexity**: The time required by an algorithm to produce output for an input of size ‘n’. It is represented by the function *T(n)*, time required per the input size n.
 
 - **Space Complexity**: The memory that an algorithm is going to consume to produce output for an input of size ‘n’. It is represented by the function *S(n)*, memory used per the input size n.
